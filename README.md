**Description**

We have built an early prototype for the system which loads the 
data from all csv files and updates the system with stored data.
After loading the data then we just make few calls to system
and display the data gathered.

we display few things on terminal:
- Properties with tax over due for specified year
- List of all owner properties
- All owner PropertyIDs and their tax due, payment status
- Garry(Owner) makes a payment for his property id 1
- Displaying tax stats for a specified year and Ericode area
- Displaying all Over Due Props for a specified year and Ericode area

**How to Run**

on BlueJ program

- download files "src" folder
- run "LoadAndShowData.java"
